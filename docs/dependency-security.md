# Dependency Security & Auditing

How Hot Sheet keeps its dependencies current and screened for known
vulnerabilities. Hot Sheet ships from three dependency ecosystems, and all
three are covered:

- **npm** — the published `hotsheet` package (`dist/` + the Tauri-bundled Node
  sidecar's `node_modules`).
- **cargo** — the Rust/Tauri desktop crate under `src-tauri/`.
- **github-actions** — the workflow files themselves.

## Automated auditing (HS-8601)

`.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` runs on every pull request, on push to
`main`, on a weekly schedule (Mondays), and on demand (`workflow_dispatch`). It
is a **dedicated** workflow, not a job inside `release-candidate.yml`, because
the release workflow only triggers on `v*-rc.*` / `v*-beta.*` tags — it could
only catch an advisory at release time, whereas advisories are disclosed
independently of our release cadence.

Two jobs:

- **`npm-audit`** — `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`. Production tree
  only: the dev toolchain (eslint, vitest, nyc, sass, tsup, esbuild, …) never
  ships, so `--omit=dev` keeps the signal on what actually ends up in `dist/`
  and the sidecar. **Blocking** as of HS-8602 (the production tree is clean — see
  the baseline note below).
- **`cargo-audit`** — `cargo audit` against `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` via the
  RustSec advisory DB. Before HS-8601, nothing screened the shipped desktop
  binary's crates at all. **Blocking** as of HS-8649 (the Rust baseline is clean
  at the `vulnerability` level — see the cargo baseline note below). Plain
  `cargo audit` fails only on `vulnerability` advisories; `unmaintained` /
  `unsound` advisories surface as non-failing warnings (the workflow does NOT
  pass `--deny warnings`), so the residual informational warnings documented
  below don't gate.

## Dependabot (HS-8601)

`.github/dependabot.yml` opens weekly dependency-update PRs for all three
ecosystems. Minor + patch updates are **grouped** per ecosystem so routine
bumps arrive as one reviewable PR; major bumps open individually so a breaking
change gets its own review.

## The current baseline & the "reachability" triage rule (HS-8592 / HS-8602)

The HS-8592 audit reported a scary-looking ~55 (30 moderate / 25 high), but most
of it was noise. **HS-8602 cleared it.** A plain `npm update` (semver-compatible
bumps only — no `--force`) pulled the in-range fixes and dropped the count to **3
moderate / 0 high**:

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.27.1 → 1.29.0, which in turn upgraded the bundled
  Express 5 transitive stack (`path-to-regexp` → 8.4.2, `qs` → 6.15.2), clearing
  the bulk of the high-severity production advisories.
- The genuinely reachable production items: `ws` 8.20.0 → 8.21.0,
  `marked` 18.0.0 → 18.0.4 (plus `hono` 4.12.7 → 4.12.23).

After the bumps:

- **`npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reports 0 vulnerabilities** — the
  production gate now passes on a clean baseline, so its job is **blocking**.
- The only residual advisories are **3 moderate dev-only** items in the
  `nyc` → `istanbul-lib-processinfo` → `uuid` coverage chain. They are excluded
  by `--omit=dev` and below the `--audit-level=high` threshold, so they don't
  gate. npm's only offered fix is a `--force` downgrade to `nyc@14.1.1` (a
  breaking major rollback), which is not worth taking for a dev-only,
  never-shipped coverage tool. No `audit-ci`/allowlist file is needed — the
  gate's `--omit=dev --audit-level=high` scope already excludes them.

**Triage rule:** before treating a production advisory as actionable, confirm
the vulnerable code path is actually reachable from Hot Sheet's own code.
Unreachable transitive advisories (dead-code transports — e.g. the MCP SDK's
bundled Express 5 stack, which Hot Sheet never instantiates because
`src/channel.ts` uses Node's raw `createServer` + the MCP SDK `Server` class)
should be recorded with a short justification rather than chased. When the
production gate goes red, either upgrade to a fixed version or — if the advisory
is provably unreachable — document the justification here before merging.

## The cargo (src-tauri) baseline (HS-8649)

HS-8649 ran the first `cargo audit` over `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`. It reported **6
vulnerabilities + 21 informational warnings**. The same in-range-fix-first rule
the npm side uses cleared every `vulnerability`:

- **`rustls-webpki` 0.103.9 → 0.103.13** — clears four advisories: RUSTSEC-2026-0104
  (reachable panic in CRL parsing), RUSTSEC-2026-0098 / -0099 (name-constraint
  matching bugs), RUSTSEC-2026-0049 (CRL distribution-point matching). Transitive
  via Tauri's TLS stack. Patch-level bump within `0.103.x`.
- **`tar` 0.4.44 → 0.4.46** — clears RUSTSEC-2026-0067 (`unpack_in` symlink chmod,
  medium 5.1) and RUSTSEC-2026-0068 (PAX size-header handling, medium 5.1).
  Patch-level bump.

Both were applied with a plain `cargo update -p rustls-webpki -p tar` (semver-
compatible; no other crates moved). After the bumps **`cargo audit` exits 0** —
no vulnerabilities — so the job is **blocking**.

The **21 residual warnings are all `unmaintained` / `unsound` informational
advisories**, not vulnerabilities, and plain `cargo audit` does not fail on them:

- **gtk-rs GTK3 bindings — unmaintained** (`atk` / `atk-sys` / `gdk` / `gdk-sys`
  / `gdkwayland-sys` / `gdkx11` / `gdkx11-sys` / `gtk` / `gtk-sys` / `gtk3-macros`,
  RUSTSEC-2024-0411…0420; plus the `glib` 0.18.5 unsoundness RUSTSEC-2024-0429).
  These are **Linux-only** GUI deps pulled in transitively by the Tauri/`rfd`
  stack; they don't ship on macOS/Windows builds and the gtk-rs project's "no
  longer maintained" status is a whole-ecosystem notice with no patched version
  to move to (it's superseded by gtk4 bindings, a major-version migration owned
  upstream by Tauri, not by Hot Sheet).
- **`rand` unsound (RUSTSEC-2026-0097, three versions) + `fxhash` /
  `proc-macro-error` / `unic-*` unmaintained** — all transitive, no patched
  version offered, and the `rand` unsoundness is conditional on "a custom
  logger that calls `rand::rng()`" which Hot Sheet's Rust code does not do.

None are reachable-and-fixable today; they're tracked here per the reachability
rule and will clear as Tauri advances its own dependency tree. If a future
`cargo audit` reports a NEW `vulnerability` (not warning) advisory, the blocking
job goes red — upgrade to the fixed version, or document an unreachable
justification here before merging.

## Running the audits locally

```bash
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high     # production npm tree
npm audit                                   # everything, incl. dev toolchain
cargo audit                                 # from src-tauri/ (needs cargo-audit)
```

## Attack-surface review at release (HS-8987)

Dependency auditing (above) covers *known-CVE* exposure in third-party code. It
does **not** cover Hot Sheet's *own* attack surface — the routes, WebSocket
endpoints, OTLP ingest, MCP tools, plugin/keychain handling, and the
`--bind`/`trustedOrigins` exposure model (HS-7940 / HS-8983 / the HS-8985
strong-auth design in `docs/94-strong-remote-auth.md`).

The **`security-review` Claude skill** (`.claude/skills/security-review/SKILL.md`)
is the standing mechanism for that, run before each release: it re-derives the
attack surface from the current code (not a static list), checks each surface
(authn/authz before execution, input/abuse pre-filtering, injection, path
traversal, SSRF, secret leakage, CSRF/CSWSH, transport), does **proactive
external research** each run (latest advisories/CVEs for the actual dependency
versions + current attack patterns — not just training knowledge), and writes a
dated, severity-ranked report to `docs/security/security-review-YYYY-MM-DD.md`,
filing a `security`-tagged ticket per actionable finding. Run it on demand or as
a release-checklist step.
