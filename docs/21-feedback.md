# 21. Feedback Needed Notes

## Overview

AI tools and automated workflows can request user feedback by adding notes with special prefixes to tickets. When the user opens a ticket with pending feedback, a dialog prompts them to respond. This enables bidirectional communication between AI tools and users without requiring the AI to wait or poll.

## Functional Requirements

### 21.1 Feedback Note Prefixes

- Two prefixes are supported, checked only on the most recent note of a ticket:
  - `FEEDBACK NEEDED:` — Standard feedback request. Shows dialog when the ticket is opened.
  - `IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK NEEDED:` — Urgent request. Automatically selects the ticket (if the project tab is active) so the dialog appears immediately.
- The text after the prefix is the prompt displayed to the user.
- Once the user responds (or any new note is added), the feedback state clears because the new note becomes the most recent and doesn't have a feedback prefix.

### 21.2 Feedback Dialog

- Appears automatically when a ticket with pending feedback is opened in the detail panel.
- Shows the prompt text rendered as markdown.
- Provides a text area for the user's response.
- Supports file attachments (same pattern as the Not Working dialog).
- Action buttons (left to right):
  - **Later** (left side, styled as a muted link): Dismisses the dialog without action. The feedback state persists — the dialog will reappear next time the ticket is opened.
  - **No Response Needed** (right side): Adds a note with text `NO RESPONSE NEEDED`, clearing the feedback state.
  - **Submit** (right side, primary): Creates a new note with the response text, uploads attachments, and notifies the Claude Channel (if connected) that feedback was provided.
- Click-outside-overlay dismisses the dialog (same as "Later").
- The dialog only auto-shows once per detail-panel open (tracked by note ID) to avoid re-opening on every poll refresh.

### 21.3 Provide Feedback Link

- In the detail panel, below notes that have a feedback prefix (when that note is the most recent), a "Provide Feedback" link button appears.
- Clicking it re-opens the feedback dialog, in case the user dismissed it earlier.

### 21.4 Immediate Feedback Auto-Select

- When `IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK NEEDED:` is detected on any ticket during the poll cycle, the ticket is automatically selected (if no other ticket is currently selected).
- This does NOT switch project tabs — it only applies to the currently active project.
- The auto-select triggers `syncDetailPanel()`, which loads the detail and auto-shows the feedback dialog.

### 21.5 Ticket Indicator Dot

- Tickets with pending feedback (last note has a feedback prefix) show a blue dot in both list view and column view, using the same `.ticket-unread-dot` styling as unread indicators.
- This is in addition to the unread dot — a ticket can show a dot for either reason.

### 21.6 Project Tab Indicator

- When any ticket in a project has pending feedback, a blue dot appears on the project tab (same style as the permissions attention dot).
- The dot clears when all feedback notes in the project are resolved (responded to, or "No Response Needed" added).
- Priority order for tab dots: permissions attention > feedback > channel busy.

### 21.6 Channel Notification

- When the user submits feedback and the Claude Channel is alive, `triggerChannelAndMarkBusy` is called with a message: `"Feedback was provided on ticket {ticketNumber}. Please re-read the worklist and continue work on this ticket."`
- This re-triggers the AI to process the updated ticket.

### 21.7 AI Tool Integration

- The worklist.md includes a "Requesting User Feedback" section with curl examples for both standard and immediate feedback.
- AI tool skill version is bumped so the skills regenerate with the new instructions.
- AI tools add feedback notes via the standard `PATCH /api/tickets/{id}` endpoint with `{"notes": "FEEDBACK NEEDED: ..."}`.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 21.8 Implementation

- Core module: `src/client/feedbackDialog.tsx` — parsing, dialog rendering, channel notification
- Note rendering: `src/client/noteRenderer.tsx` — "Provide Feedback" link
- Detail panel: `src/client/detail.tsx` — auto-show on ticket open
- Poll: `src/client/poll.tsx` — IMMEDIATE auto-select, feedback state scanning
- Project tabs: `src/client/projectTabs.tsx` — blue dot state management
- Worklist: `src/sync/markdown.ts` — AI instructions
- DB: `last_read_at` column (unrelated to feedback but enables unread detection)
